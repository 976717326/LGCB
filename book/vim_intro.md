title: Vim Introduction
---


When I learn a new software tool, I really want a tutorial that goes like
story-telling, and I can learn things from easy to difficult. In this sense
the __vim__ official help files(these you get by typing `:h` in __vim__) are 
nice, but still there are two things I want for my students:

    - less stuff, so that we only focus on the most important
    - easier English, so that my students can read with smiles

so here this is my guide to the __vim__ official help files, enjoy.

Screencasts can be a lot of help in learning __vim__, so I am building some in
easy English, following the flow of __vim__ `:h`, focusing on only basic stuff,
and giving extra explain whenever I think is necessary.

All the Screencasts are here:
