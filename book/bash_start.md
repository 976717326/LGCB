title: Getting Started

So let's get started. Launch the terminal emulator! Once it comes up, we
should see
something like this:

    peter@vostro:~$ 



This is called a shell prompt and it will appear whenever the shell is ready
to accept input.  it will usually include your "username@machinename", followed
by the current working directory (more about that in a little bit) and a
dollar sign. As above shows, "peter" is "username", and "vostro" is the name
of my machine.

## Your First Keystrokes
Assuming that things are good so far, let's try some typing. Type some junk at
the prompt like so:

    peter@vostro:~$ sddsdss
    sddsdss: command not found

Since this command makes no sense, the shell will tell us "command not found"
.
## Command History
If we press the up-arrow key, we will see that the previous command "sddsdss"
reappears after the prompt. This is called command history. Most Linux
distributions remember the last five hundred commands by default. Press the
down-arrow key and the previous command disappears.

## Cursor Movement
Recall the previous command with the up-arrow key again. Now try the left and
right- arrow keys. See how we can position the cursor anywhere on the command
line?  This makes editing commands easy.

## Try Some Simple Commands
Now that we have learned to type, let's try a few simple commands. The first
one is date. This command displays the current time and date.

    peter@vostro:~$ date
    Tue Jan 18 21:46:56 CST 2011

Now Linux command line is no longer a stranger to you.
