What is version control, and why should you care? 

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files
over time so that you can recall specific versions later. As a programmer, you
usually want to control software source code,though in reality you can do this
with nearly any type of files.

I won't suggest your reading this though it is actually useful. Have this, and
read this later, if you find it is too difficult for you.
