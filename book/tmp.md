_important term_

---------------------------

I just want lessons for LGCB, not chapters, and every lesson I add will be
there forever(the url will be permanent, so that I can link to it from
anywhere), I can only better the page, but not removing it. 

I am free to change the index of the book.

I will try to make each lesson cover a complete topic, but this should give
way to keeping the story-telling style of this book, that is starting from
ZERO, and then go step by step. Say, I want to talk about __vim__ movement, which
will be too much stuff to be wrapped into one single chapter, than I will
choose to have a "3.2 vim basic movement" to fullfill the basic needs of the
students, then may be in 3.10 or 3.20, when the students get more at home with
__vim__, I can add another chapter named "vim advanced movement". 

Conciseness over Preciseness.

I don't teach bash first and __vim__ later, so put chapter1 or 2 before them is
ridiculous. I think I will teach this way:

I will first finish one or two lessons of Bash, then I will move to git or
__vim__
and pick up one or two lessons as needed.

## linfo

linfo.org is special in that it is really sth for Linux newbies, focusing on
only important concepts(like GCC, Linux, platform), and it limits the talk
only with in the materials interesting to beginners. linfo Rocks!

And its simplicity looks really sexy to me, and I am tempted to creat my own
linfo. I want to add pics, I want a search bar.
