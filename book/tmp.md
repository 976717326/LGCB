---------------------------

I just want lessons for LGCB, not chapters, and every lesson I add will be
there forever(the url will be permanent, so that I can link to it from
anywhere), I can only better the page, but not removing it. 

I am free to change the index of the book.

I will try to make each lesson cover a complete topic, but this should give
way to keeping the story-telling style of this book, that is starting from
ZERO, and then go step by step. Say, I want to talk about vim movement, which
will be too much stuff to be wrapped into one single chapter, than I will
choose to have a "3.2 vim basic movement" to fullfill the basic needs of the
students, then may be in 3.10 or 3.20, when the students get more at home with
vim, I can add another chapter named "vim advanced movement". Keep it simple
and let it grow.

## linfo

linfo.org is special in that it is really sth for Linux newbies, focusing on
only important concepts(like GCC, Linux, platform), and it limits the talk
only with in the materials interesting to beginners. linfo Rocks!

And its simplicity looks really sexy to me, and I am tempted to creat my own
linfo. I want to add pics, I want a search bar.
