To get help on a given subject, use the following command: >

	:help {subject}

To get help on the "x" command, for example, enter the following: >

	:help x

To find out how to delete text, use this command: >

	:help deleting

To get a complete index of all Vim commands, use the following command: >

	:help index

When you need to get help for a control character command (for example,
CTRL-A), you need to spell it with the prefix "CTRL-". >

	:help CTRL-A

The Vim editor has many different modes.  By default, the help system displays
the normal-mode commands.  For example, the following command displays help
for the normal-mode CTRL-H command: >

	:help CTRL-H

To identify other modes, use a mode prefix.  If you want the help for the
insert-mode version of a command, use "i_".  For CTRL-H this gives you the
following command: >

	:help i_CTRL-H
