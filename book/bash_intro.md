## Why Use The Command Line?
Have you ever noticed in the movies when the "super hacker" sits down at
the computer, he never touches a mouse? It's because movie makers realize that
we, as human beings, instinctively know the only way to really get anything
done on a computer is by typing on a keyboard.

Most computer users today are only familiar with the graphical user interface
(GUI) and have been taught that the command line interface (CLI) is a
difficult thing of the past. This is unfortunate, because a good command line
interface is a very expressive way of communicating with a computer in much
the same way the written word is for human beings. It's been said that
"graphical user interfaces make easy tasks easy, while command line interfaces
make difficult tasks possible" and this is still very true today.

## What Is The Shell?  
When we speak of the command line, we are really referring to the shell. The
shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the
operating system to carry out(funny are the names: _Shell_ on top of
_Kernel_). Almost all Linux distributions supply a shell program from the GNU
Project called bash, so does ubuntu. 

The name __bash__ is short for "Bourne Again SHell" a program written by Steve
Bourne.  

## Terminal Emulators
When using a graphical user interface, we need another program called a
__terminal emulator__ to interact with the shell. If we look through our
desktop menus, we will probably find one. Ubuntu by defualt uses
__gnome-terminal__, though it's likely called simply __terminal__ on our menu.
You can take terminal as nothing but a simple window, it by itself does
nothing but give us access to the shell.
