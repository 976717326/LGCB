title: Is Linux For Me?
---

The question is actually that nowadays in China, many young people do not know
what to do to make a living, and also others actually making enough money do not
love their job and want to do a switch, so that their talents won't be wasted.  

So they ask me: Is Linux for me?

Well I don't know, Linux a big world, something to big too comment on , but I
can tell you the story of how Linux changed my life.

## I wanted to be useful to the world 
Back in the year 2006, I did not really know what to do with my life, I
wanted to work hard and make clean money. And I wanted to share what I created
with people I love. 

Linux is the way for me to make clean money. I want to be respected by other
people, not because I have a lot of money or some position, but that I have my
creativeness, and willing to share. 

## Linux vs Windows?

It is cool to become a Linux programmer, cause you have freedom.
And In Microsoft world, it is not, I do not like the way they work.
