title: Why English?
---

As a programmer, reading documents is part of your daily work. No matter you
want it or not, you have to read lots of them in English as well. 

Knowing where everything is, is a good start for finding the right things.

### Tutorial vs Manual, and things go between. 

Try to start to learn something new by a __tutorial__, starting with a
__manual__ is usually not a good idea.

Say, you want to learn a nice debugger named __gdb__, and its official manual
is very easy to find (at www.gnu.org), but if you are new to gdb, then reading
this manual would only make you live in hell, since a manual need to be formal
and need to cover all the details of __gdb__, so a newbie might easliy feel
lost reading it. Then what is the right approach? Try to google "gdb
tutorial", and see what you will get.

Note,some manual have a simple tutorial in its first chapters, so that's
really nice.



### vocabulary

These days when I see some words I do not know, I often turn to 
<http://dict.youdao.com/>

But IT vocabulary is not so easy to learn, it is that sometimes you still have
no idea what a word is talking about even its Chinese translation is there.
Than you need  
### wikipedia

Say I want to know what is __vim__, all I need to do is to google "vim wiki".

And sometimes if you need a tool for a job, but there are several software out
here that are all doing the same job, now you just want to know which is the
best, this is not so easy to find out on their offical site, because no one
will say that their own project is worse then other people's. then you can go
to wikipedia to see how outsiders thing of it.
