## Why this book?    

Now I am getting a lot of requests from my students that they need a textbook,
that's why I want to write this. I need a book that covers all that I want to
share with my students, no more and no less. _the linux command line_ is nice,
but it is too difficult for my students.

I want to name this book _Linux Guide for Chinese Beginners_.

## Who should read this book?
### This book is for Chinese people
As a Chinese, I know my fellow citizen generally do not speak English well, but
I do believe that no matter what is your birth tongue, as long as you want to
learn Linux, you should use English as your language for work. Otherwise you
are on the wrong track. Learning materials in Chinese are so hard to find, and
the translations are usually very bad.

There are surely some beginner's guides on web, but most Chinese people still
feel frustrated reading. So here this book will fill this gap, and it will
serve as a guide to those guides, written in really easy English(slightly
broken, sorry), giving a new tech term only when very necessary, and it will
be explained the way that makes non-native English speakers feel comfortable. 

### the book is for absolute beginners
If you are already have several years experience, this book might be too easy
for you. My goals doing this book are:

 - as easy as possible 
 - as interesting as possible

I will try to concentrate only on things that are important for beginners,
keep it simple and stupid. While at the same time avoid making this book
loaded with nothing but quick and dirty tricks. Attention is paid to show the
readers the whole picture, and teach them to do things the right way, so that
they can feel natural in their next step learning.

## what's in this book
It is really all about how to survive in the new world of Linux. It is not
about something hard, but rather about helping you out when you are lost in
the vast ocean of Linux knowledge. 

If you just migrant from other country (maybe some nasty place named
MS-windows), and you want to live free in the kingdom of Linux.  And Hey I am
Peter, your new friend here, I will show you with this book the most important
languages you should speak(not only C, but something like python, xml...), new
tools you can not leave without(bash as a new way to talk to your computer,
vim as a editor, git to do version control and a lot more...), and of course
when I am busy, you can study in this library(lots of wonderful links to good
books, with my comments go along).

Note that this book is very ubuntu-centric. There are kinds of Linux (distros
to be precise), ubuntu is now the most popular one . Playing with only one
distro can effectively avoid talking about dark corners, add the possibility
to do things right and build confidence.

## How to read this book
I think the right way to learn Linux is pretty much like learning a foreign
language. You do not learn one thing in full detail, and the move to
another.(that's why usually it is not wise to learn chapter by chapter), but
that you learn basic vocabulary of all necessary fields(very basic things about
bash, vim...) and then try to talk to sb(your computer). Of course, you will
soon find out your knowledge is limited, then you will be happy to go back to
your textbooks to learn things that look interesting to you.(and again, you
may still leave more complicated thing along). Anyway, you know what I mean,
learning by doing, keep it simple and let it grow.

But for this book, as its design goes, I will try to keep things really easy,
and let it be possible to finish each part in one go without frustrations.
And the above rules may still fit for the more advanced books that I will
bring to you in this book. But this book is just the "basic vocabulary of all
necessary fields".

You can just start at the beginning of the book and follow it to the end. It
isn't written as a reference work, it's really more like a story with a
beginning, middle, and an end.
