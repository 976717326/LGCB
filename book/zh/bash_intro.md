## What is a Command?

## 什么叫做“命令”？

A command is merely an instruction provided by a user telling a computer to do
something, such as launch a program. 

命令就是用户向计算机发的指令，告诉计算机完成一个我想要的的任务，比如说给我启动一个程序。

## Why Use The Command Line?

## 为什么要采用“命令行”的方式来操作电脑？

Have you ever noticed in the movies when the "super hacker" sits down at
the computer, he never touches a mouse? It's because movie makers realize that
we, as human beings, instinctively know the only way to really get anything
done on a computer is by typing on a keyboard.

你以前有没有见过在电影里有些超级黑客是怎么操作电脑的，为什么那些人从来都不碰鼠标？因为电影制作人知道, 在普通人的直觉中，如果真正想用电脑干活的话，那唯一的方式就是敲键盘。



Most computer users today are only familiar with the graphical user interface
(GUI) and have been taught that the command line interface (CLI) is a
difficult thing of the past. This is unfortunate, because a good command line
interface is a very expressive way of communicating with a computer in much
the same way the written word is for human beings. It's been said that
"graphical user interfaces make easy tasks easy, while command line interfaces
make difficult tasks possible" and this is still very true today.

当今，大部分的电脑使用者只熟悉图形化的用户界面，而认为命令行是过时的，而且很难。这种看法是不对的，因为只有命令行才是人类和电脑交流的最富表现力的方式，就好象人和人交流的最好方式是使用文字一样。曾经有人这样说：图形化的用户界面可以让用户简便的完成一些简单任务，而对于复杂任务却只能通过敲命令才可能实现。这个说法即使在今天看来也是非常正确的。
