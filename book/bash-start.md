So let's get started. Launch the terminal emulator! Once it comes up, we
should see
something like this:

    peter@vostro:~$ 



This is called a shell prompt and it will appear whenever the shell is ready
to accept input.  it will usually include your username@machinename, followed
by the current working directory (more about that in a little bit) and a
dollar sign. As above shows, `peter` is `username`, and `vostro` is the name
of my machine.

## Your First Keystrokes
Assuming that things are good so far, let's try some typing. Type some junk at
the prompt like so:

peter@vostro:~$ sddsdss
sddsdss: command not found

Since this command makes no sense, the shell will tell us `command not found`
