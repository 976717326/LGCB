## why normal mode first?

when you already understand why vim has different modes, you may still wonder,
why vim first takes us to _normal mode_(also called _command mode_) rather
than _insert mode_

It is because in a programmer's daily editing, most time are spent to modify
things, not adding text. and in normal mode you can really move around much
faster, and changing things much easier.

## Moving around 

To move the cursor, press the h,j,k,l keys as indicated. 

             ^
             k              Hint:  The h key is at the left and moves left.
       < h       l >               The l key is at the right and moves right.
             j                     The j key looks like a down arrow.
             v
