title: Git Introduction
---

When we write code, it's very nice to be able to keep track of all of our
changes such that we can always go back to an earlier version when we mess
something up. It's also really important to coordinate our changes with others
working on the same code. For these reasons, programmers use programs called
_Version Control Systems_ to manage their code. Git is a VCS.

Git is the stupid content tracker, which means it tracks your data easily.


## NOTE:

<http://progit.org> already there, and it even has a Chinese version, so I hope I
won't repeat what others already did.
