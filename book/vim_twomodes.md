vim is different from the editors you know largely in that it has something
called _mode_.

The Vim editor is a modal editor.  That means that the editor behaves
differently, depending on which mode you are in.  The two basic modes are
called Normal mode and Insert mode.  In Normal mode the characters you type
are commands.  In Insert mode the characters are inserted as text.

   Since you have just started Vim it will be in Normal mode.  To start Insert
mode you type the "i" command (i for Insert).  Then you can enter
the text.  It will be inserted into the file.
