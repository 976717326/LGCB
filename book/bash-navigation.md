# Navigation

The first thing we need to learn to do (besides just typing) is how to
navigate the file
system on our Linux system. In this chapter we will introduce the following
commands:

- `pwd`    - Print name of current working directory
- `cd`     - Change directory
- `ls`     - List directory contents
