## Why writing?

Nearly all great people from almost all cultures are great writers. It's
also important to be a good speaker, but writing has its special
position in people's careers. It is also very true for us as programmers.

Most great hackers I know are also very powerful writers, who are not
necessarily native English speakers, take Linus of Linux for example, but they
can speak, and more importantly write English in a CCC way(clearly,
convincingly, and comfortably).

## Writing is hard!

Most my friends do not write much, some even do not write at all. Here in
Beijing, I do not see a lot of people writing down their ideas in English,
because they think it is too hard.

Come on, Let's face this. Writing is hard, even in our mother tongue. 
But hey writing can be fun, let's try to write something every day. [Blogging is one way:][1]

    People spend their entire lives learning how to write effectively. It
    isn't something you can fake. It isn't something you can buy. You have to
    work at it.

    That's exactly why people who are afraid they can't write should be
    blogging.

    It's exercise. No matter how out of shape you are, if you exercise a few
    times a week, you're bound to get fitter. Write a small blog entry a few
    times every week and you're bound to become a better writer.


And diving into some programming forums can also help, posting a question,
trying to answer people's questions with small number of words, but do give
them in a CCC way, this is much easier than a 1000 words blog entry. And
[Hacker News][2] is a great place to go in this sense.

You see writing is not so hard, like what I am doing here now. But I won't
hide I am stealing ideas from [this nice post on writing][3].
