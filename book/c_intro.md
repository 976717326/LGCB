title: C Introduction

Back in 2002, when I was in college and given a course on C, I failed because
I hated it. That is:

    - C is difficult
    - I do not know how it can be of some use, dame!

So, ok, now is the year of 2011, I am trying to teach other people to use C,
so I want to go LGCB story-telling style and try to make this lanaguage easy
to learn, and make people understand C is useful.

## Learn C the easy way

In most C books, you get a whole chapter on one single topic, say _data type_.
Now you get whole lot of details about this. I won't say this is wrong, since
this might be the only way to do a serious book. But I want to say, beginners
ususally can't tell what is the most important part.  For me it is better only
to show the students int and char, so that they they can 

    - do real code right now
    - only to learn what is float when they need to

this is what I called the easy way, so LGCB won't be a "serious book", can it
will just behave like a good friend showing you something cool about C.

## Usefulness Brings Interests

Now we have the easy way to learn, it is then easy to convince people  the
details are somewhat useful.

Say, now somebody wants me to learn what is a C function, he first need to
show me why function is cool, and make what I want to do a lot easier(rather
than make my job more painful:). Because I started the easy way, and now
already done some lines of code, so just show me with my OWN code!! 

So learning by doing, learn a new C feather when you feel the real need in
your project. When enough interest are gathered, you are willing to learn
more, becaue all what you learn bring elegance(not trouble) to your projects.
you are alreay a good programmer, even though you still know float and double
yet:-)
