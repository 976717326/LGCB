the book text will serve as background knowledge of these screencasts, of
course I am free to add any thing I think fits.

So let's get started. Launch vim! 

    peter@vostro:~$vim filename 

## Moving around 

To move the cursor, press the h,j,k,l keys as indicated. 

             ^
             k              Hint:  The h key is at the left and moves left.
       < h       l >               The l key is at the right and moves right.
             j                     The j key looks like a down arrow.
             v

## quit vim

now in _normal mode_, you type 

 - `:q!` quit with out change
 - `:wq` save and quit
 - __ZZ__ save and quit

Maybe you do not know what know what is _normal mode_, do not worry I will
explain soon.

## vimtutor

vimtutor is a nice way to practice vim basic operations, but it is
definitely not for absolute beginners, too difficult.  Still want to try?
invoke it this way:

    peter@vostro:~$ vimtutor
