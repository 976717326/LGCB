The book text will serve as background knowledge of these screencasts, of
course I am free to add anything that I think fits.

So let's get started. Launch __vim__! 

    peter@vostro:~$vim filename 

## quit vim

Now in _normal mode_, you type 

 - `:q!` quit with out change
 - `:wq` save and quit
 - `ZZ`  save and quit

Maybe you do not know what know what is _normal mode_, do not worry I will
explain soon.

## vimtutor

__vimtutor__ is a nice way to practice vim basic operations, but it is
definitely not for absolute beginners, too difficult.  Still want to try?
invoke it this way:

    peter@vostro:~$ vimtutor

check

1_start_vim.mov
