# introduction
## why this book?    

Now I am geting a lot of requests from my students that they need a textbook,
that's why I want to wirte this book. I need a book that covers all that I
want to share with my students, no more and no less. _the linux command
line_ is nice, but it is too difficult for my students.

I want to name this book _Linux Guide for Chinese Beginners_.

## Who should read this book?
### This book is for Chinese people
As a Chinese, I know my fellow citizen generally do not speak English well, but
I do believe that no matter what is your birth togue, as long as you want to learn
Linux, you should use English as your lanuague for work. Otherwise
you are on the wrong track, because learning
materials in Chinese is so hard to find, and the translation is usually very
bad.

There are surely lots beginners guide on web, but lots of Chinese people
still feel frustated reading. So here this book will fill this gap, and it
will serve as a guide to those guides, written in really easy
English(slightly broken, sorry), giving a new tech term only when very
necessary, and
it will be explained the way that makes non-native English speakers feel comfortable. 
### the book is for absolute beginners
If you are already have several year experience, this book might be too easy
for you. My goals doing this book are:

 - as easy as possible 
 - as interesting as possible

I will try to concnentrate only on things that are important for beginners,
keep it simple and stupid, while at the same time avoid making this book
loaded with nothing but quick and dirty tricks.  Attention is paid to show the
readers the whole picture, and teach them to do things the right way, so that
the they can feel natural in their next step learning.

## what's in this book
It is really all about how to survive in the new world of Linux. It is not
about something hard, but rather about helping you out when you are lost in
the vast ocean of linux knowledge. 

If you just migrant from other country (maybe some nasty place named
MS-windows), and you want to live free in the kingdom of Linux.  And Hey I am
Peter, your new friend here, I will show you with this book the most important
languages you should speak(not only C, but something like python, xml...), new
tools you can not leave without(bash as a new way to talk to your computer,
vim as a editor, git to do version control and a lot more...), and of course
when I am busy, you can study in this library(lots of wonderful links to good
books, with my comments go along).

## how you should read this book
The way I learn Linux, is pretty much like learning a foreign language. You do
not learn one thing in full detail, and the move to another.(that's why it is
not wise to learn chapter by chapter), but rather that you learn basic
vocablury of all necessary fileds(very basic things about bash, vim...) and then try to talk to
sb(your computer). Of course, you will soon find out your knowledge is
limited, then you will be happy to go back to your textbooks to learn things
that look interesting to you.(and again, you may still leave more complicated
thing along). Anyway, you know what I mean, learning by doing, keep it simple
and let it grow.

But for this book, as its design goes, I will try to keep things really easy,
and let it be possible to finish each part in one go without frustrations.
And the above rules may still fit for the more advanced books that I will
bring to you in this book. But this book is just the "basic vocabulary of all
necessay fields".
