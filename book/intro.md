# introduction
## why this book?    

now I get request from all my students that they need a textbook to study,
that's why I want to wirte this book. I need a book that covers all that I
want to share with my students, no more and no less. _the linux command
line_ is nice, but it has too much stuff.

I want to name this book _Linux Guide for Chinese Beginners_.
## who should read this book?
### this book is for Chinese people
As a Chinese, I know my fellow citizen generall do not speak English well, but
i do believe that no matter what is your birth togue, if you want to learn
Linux, you should use English as your lanuague for work. If you use Chinese,
you are on the wrong track, and you will regret that, because learning
materials in Chinese is so hard to find, and the translation is horriable.

and there are surely lots beginners guide on web, but lots of Chinese people
still feel frustated reading. So here this book will fill this gap, and it
will serve as a guide to those guides, writen in my really easy
English(slightly broken, sorry), giving a new tech term when I have to, and
it will be explained the way that makes non-native English speakers feel comfortable. 
### the book is for absolute beginners
If you are already have several year experience, this book might be too easy
for you. My goals doing this book:

 - as easy as possible 
 - as interesting as possible

try to concnentrate only on things that are important for beginners, try to stay simple and stupid. But avoid making this book loaded with quick and dirty tricks.  Attention is paid to do things the right way, so that the readers can feel natural learning advanced materails not covered in this book.

## what's in this book
It is really all about how to survive in the new world of Linux. It is not
about something hard, but rather about helping you out when you are lost in
the vast ocean of linux knowledge. 

I know you are just megrent from other country(maybe some nasty place named
MS-windows), and you want to start a new life in the free kingdom of Linux.
And Hey I am Peter, your new friend here, I will show you in this book the
most important languages you should speak(not only C, but something like
python, xml...), new tools you can not leave without(bash as a new way to
talk to your computer, vim as a editor, git to
do version control and a lot more...), and of course when I am busy, you can
study in this library(lots of wonderful links to good books, with my own
comments go along).

## how you should read this book

the way I learn Linux, is prety much like learning a foreign language. You do
not learn one thing in full detail, and the move to another.(that's why it is
not wise to learn chapter by chapter), but rather that you learn basic
vocablury of all necessary fileds(very basic things about bash, vim...) and then try to talk to
sb(your computer). Of course, you will soon find out your knowledge is
limited, then you will be happy to go back to your textbooks to learn things
that looks interesting to you.(and again, you may still leave more complicated
thing along). Anyway, you know what I mean, learning by doing, keep it simple
and let it grow.

But for this book, as its design goes, I will try to keep things really easy,
and let it be possible to finish each chapter in one go with out frustation.
And the above rules may still fit for the more advanced books that I will
bring to you in this book. This book is just the "basic vocabulary of all
necessay fields".
