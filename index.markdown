<h2 style="text-align:center">Linux Guide for Chinese Beginners</h2>
<br />


This [book](/LGCB/book) is in easy English talking about simple Linux stuff in
a clear way. Learning Linux is not easy for beginners, to learn in English is
very difficult for Chinese people. I hope this book can be helpful.
