# progit
LGCB will base on the code of progit.org, I will use even lighter color for graphs to make the book printer-friendly
progit have two repos, one for content, one for layouts, that's really good.
Since LGCB will have too many graphs, I will have a LGCB-assets for the pngs, much easier to maintain this way.

Gimp->image->scale img, set the width to 600
# gittalk
scott use big font words to show important things, really nice
scott does not use mouse to point things, instead he use a redbox with trasparent inner part and a thick border, really nice.

Less formal, more mistakes, but this bring more relaxed and natural style and more passion in the video, so this is nice.
# similarity and differneces
1. LGCB is differnt from happycasts in that it foucs on basic knowledge,
trying to make readers understand the structure and concepts.
2. LGCB is differnet from a common textbook in that it "shows not tells", give users the screen, type in the commands you are talking about. But again, the purpose is "understanding" not "getting the job done", so show people the things that are structurally important. However useful a command or a option is in daily life, if it does not help with the understanding of the strucure, is considered noise.

3. Every LGCB lesson shall like a stroy, simple clear and fun to read. If a lesson has 17 parts, that tend to be boring, make it 3 or 4, make it fit the natural flow of our mind.

4. "cutting noise" does not means show people as few things as I can. e.g. If I am talking about `chmod`, actually it helps to add `ls -l`, it is not noise but signal. While never try to show people all the options of `chmod`, even though these things are clearly on topic, but do not add more than necessary of these. Too many details, no good!

# structure

LGCB will have several PARTS: vim, git, bash ...
each PART has 5 or 10 lessons
All lessons shall have the same length and format
each lession has 10mins video and 20mins reading
the readings are just the printable LGCB book, shall be able to live without the video.
the book will be the ASCIIcasts of the videos???
    I won't use slides in the video, I will use some pics(some size, some theme color...) when I really want to explain things, and I can embed all the pics directed into the ASCIIcasts, reall neat, aha?

# difference from happycasts

Of course all the parts are independent.  but all lessons in same part are
dependent on eariler ones, so it is a step-by-step tutorial.

LGCB will focus on sth big, complex. I put the lessons together, because I
have to, they are related, and they are parts of one big monster. If I want to
show people how to setup wuftp, or use ubuntu software center, I will do it in
a happycast.
