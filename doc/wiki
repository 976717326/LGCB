LGCB will have several PARTS: vim, git, bash ...
each PART has 5 or 10 lessons
All lessons shall have the same length and format
each lession has 10mins video and 20mins reading
the readings are just the printable LGCB book, shall be able to live without the video.
the book will be the ASCIIcasts of the videos???

# difference from happycasts

Of course all the parts are independent.  but all lessons in same part are
dependent on eariler ones, so it is a step-by-step tutorial.

LGCB will focus on sth big, complex. I put the lessons together, because I
have to, they are related, and they are parts of one big monster. If I want to
show people how to setup wuftp, or use ubuntu software center, I will do it in
a happycast.

LGCB will focus on making people understand. NOT "get the job done". we will
still "show do not tell" though.
